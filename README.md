# Imporant things when new host enter AirBnB Platform in Singapore 
This project is the mid-term project from Data Science Bootcamp at Coder School, VN

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective
- The purpose of this project is to identify factors that distinguish a normal host to a host labeled as super host. For example: is there a difference in number of amenities between normal host and super host, same goes for locations, price, room type, etc.

### Methods Used
* Data Visualization

### Technologies 
* Python
* Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
* BeautifulSoup, Stopwords, WordNetLemmatizer
* TextBlob
* Folium heatmap

## Project Description
- The data of this project came from kaggle (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)). Our team firstly played around with the data with the attempt to find any insights that were abnormal and we luckily, we did find one when we analysed the users response's comments.
- We kept that abnormal insight as our main idea and went out to find difference between host and superhost based on total amenities, prices, locations, host_reponse_time, review_score, number of beds and bedrooms and finally room type
- Nevertheless, this could be because of the nature of this dataset (specifically from Singapore) that we could rarely identify any significant differents between host and superhost based on criterias listed above. This was when we felt a bit lost but luckily we still had the insight when we analyse customer's review
- The result came from analysing reviews was actually quite suprising, requirements such as cleanliness, tidiness, good decoration were thought to be a must for every listing turned out to be quite importance in customer point of view. Hosts that are not super host tend to not gurantee these requirements whereas superhost made sure these requirements were always fullfiled before customer's usage. We assumed that when a customer decided to put down a review, it would be either too bad or really good so this insight could be really helpful for new host to avoid to have their customer left out a bad reivew for their listing because of such a simple mistake
- We then gave out solutions related to this problems and end our project here
